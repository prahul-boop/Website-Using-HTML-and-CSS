# Website-Using-HTML-and-CSS
A series of websites built using basic HTML and CSS.
MY FIRST PROJECT
So, this is my first project in frontend web development ( hope I can make a lot more ), and it’s basically a series of websites for a fictional fast food outlet called “DummyKnows Pizza”.
In the series of docs:
•	Dummyknowspizza.html – Homepage
•	Dummyknows membership.html – The Membership page
•	Membership details.html – for any new members to join in
•	Dummyknowsgoals.html – for the goals of the corporation
•	Dummyknowsawards.html – for awards of the company
•	Dummyknowscareers.html – for possible careers
•	Dummyknowscontacts.html – for contacts and 
•	Onlineorderingmenu.html – for the ordering menu.
